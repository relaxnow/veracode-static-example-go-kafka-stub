# Veracode Static (Analysis) Example: Go Kafka Stub

This project demonstrates how to stub out a dependency that contains CGo.
As an example the 'confluent-kafka-go' example is stubbed out and replaced during packaging.

See the Makefile for the packaging steps.

Use this to get Kafka up and running on minikube: https://technology.amis.nl/platform/kubernetes/running-apache-kafka-on-minikube/

See this for the stub used: https://github.com/relaxnow/veracode-static-example-go-kafka-stub
